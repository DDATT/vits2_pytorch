DUMMY1/wavs/cd_25001.wav|and make me laugh when I feel down.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_11002.wav|Nothing. I am nothing without you. You complete me.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_51001.wav|My dear followers, I do not think that this is the right stream to explain to you what this would be
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_16001.wav|Yes, thank you! Now scoot over, cause I wanna sit on the left side.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_1001.wav|Sister, I have sinned I've done nothing but draw Miri Celesta for hours upon hours for days upon days I can't get her out of my drawings, even when I try to draw something else She's there in the corner
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_30001.wav|Sometimes, you're the only thing that I wanna hear. And I just wanna listen to you talk all day.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_23003.wav|and witty. You never fail to brighten up my day when I talk to you.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_13002.wav|Do not regret your choices in the future. Go give, go give your friends those gifts. I am sure they will appreciate. This is not a sin!
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_7001.wav|You are able to be slightly devious from time to time as long as it does not harm anyone else You are okay
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_10003.wav|God, you were there to catch me when I kept almost falling.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_22001.wav|Do you regret it? Are you remorseful?
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_3001.wav|Anytime I spend with you is fun, I suppose.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_39001.wav|No absolution. Burn.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_21001.wav|Sometimes the whole entire circus! Heh... And, can't forget...
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_50001.wav|What do you mean you tried to make it obvious?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_20002.wav|May you find the strength to wake up earlier.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_31003.wav|Regret it now, but man it was worth it for the foil Joker.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_9002.wav|From real life and in fiction, there is no problem.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_9002.wav|You really mean so much to me, so I really wanted to impress you.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_32002.wav|I just think you're really amazing.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_13001.wav|Do you think we can sit on this bench for a little bit?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_36003.wav|you will be burned at the stake.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_14002.wav|And the night view is really nice right now.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_53001.wav|with your feelings.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_58001.wav|And I coincidentally need someone to help me set up this mini Christmas tree that I bought.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_43002.wav|You will not attain heaven.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_4002.wav|You mean it? Hehehe I'm so relieved you think the same
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_40001.wav|I have feelings for you.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_34001.wav|I am not turning red. I am not turning red.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_10001.wav|Be careful on what you indulge in.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_42002.wav|It's okay, it's alright. It is not a sin.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_17001.wav|You have a question for me?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_48001.wav|We must be forgiving and open.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_36001.wav|And hence.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_27001.wav|Thank you very much. Take the kid while he's down and beat him. Sister that is a bit extreme.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_40001.wav|Collars add an extra flavor. I think it's more delicious when it's done by someone with the opposite demeanor. Like a usually soft five person.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_11003.wav|Nothing impure.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_54002.wav|It's so surreal.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_11001.wav|I know, I know.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_33001.wav|I've said too much, haven't I?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_9001.wav|As long as you keep those urges separate.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_42001.wav|I'm okay. I think I just dressed a little too lightly for the night.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_35001.wav|Today I learned that is evil.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_20001.wav|I understand.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_25002.wav|I love listening to you when you talk about something you enjoy. It makes me really happy.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_43003.wav|May you burn in the deepest, darkest pits of hell.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_1003.wav|watched a movie?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_42001.wav|Dear my fellow lambs who feel the same way,
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_48001.wav|suddenly hold my hands like that.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_44001.wav|I don't actually drink any alcohol, but I still say Kanpai in chat.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_31001.wav|When I was nine, me and two other friends stole a bunch of Pokemon cards from a popular kid in school.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_25001.wav|Next time, KK Mile is at the ground
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_24001.wav|You are free to laugh at any child you want.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_2002.wav|Everything was so much fun.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_35002.wav|Okay, my dear lamb, it seems that the followers of the church have agreed.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_30001.wav|Sister Mio must clear her throat.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_5002.wav|Thank you.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_18001.wav|First, how do you feel about me?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_14001.wav|I have two things to confess. For one thing, I told Mireille Celeste to take care of her health and made a calorie related joke.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_6001.wav|You know, I really wanted to do things we could both enjoy together.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_20001.wav|even start.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_49001.wav|You told me how you felt about me.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_39002.wav|Burn. You will be punished!
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_9001.wav|Thank you!
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_17002.wav|how I...
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_54001.wav|You're so close to me.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_24002.wav|Children are the spawn of devils.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_30002.wav|Please excuse her for one minute.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_45001.wav|You're gonna let me keep it for the rest of the night?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_52001.wav|I will not be the one to enlighten you today
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_28002.wav|my fellow follower.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_10001.wav|Oh, you know what was really funny though?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_32001.wav|That is okay. As a child committing acts of crime against other children, small acts of crime does not count as a sin.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_11001.wav|Yes, but just for a date!
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_31001.wav|That doesn't mean I only care about you talking to me. I just really love hanging out with you and being in your presence in general.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_37002.wav|This is a big sin. Thank you, dear followers of the church.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_39001.wav|Why are you acting so oblivious?
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_35001.wav|I just think I really really like you.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_55001.wav|I want to experience so many things and spend so much more time with you.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_36002.wav|you will be burned.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_23003.wav|Our church is forgiving.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_20003.wav|Do not worry.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_56001.wav|Please, there's no sin in wanting to make a fellow follower feel loved. However, I do not think she would enjoy this.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_59001.wav|Would you want to come over to my place for the evening?
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_22002.wav|I'll try to be serious.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_4001.wav|Really?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_38001.wav|for letting this poor poor lamb see the light.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_10004.wav|Thank you for your confession.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_29001.wav|mention, you're ridiculously cute. And I know you don't think so, but...
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_8001.wav|Next confession, I listen to ASMR road plays almost every night, especially yandere ones.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_23002.wav|Funny?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_48002.wav|We must be forgiving and open, do not worry! Do not worry.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_19002.wav|I understand if it's too hard.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_6002.wav|and especially since it's the holidays.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_2001.wav|Had some delicious food and drinks.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_25002.wav|Kick him while he's on the ground.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_41002.wav|Perhaps it would do you some...
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_15001.wav|Also, can't forget this mini Christmas tree that you convinced me to buy today. Do you have any idea how heavy this is?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_12002.wav|I have a shrine filled with all of the things my friends have touched or gifted me over the years. The shrine also consists of gifts I have made for people, but I've never actually given them.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_31002.wav|even stole in the middle of class.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_37001.wav|Not just like, between friends.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_5001.wav|Next confession When I was in elementary school, I stole a 50 cent candy from the store
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_29001.wav|heed this, heed this teaching.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_26001.wav|your excited expression and your tone. It's so adorable.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_10002.wav|But from time to time, there should not be a problem
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_28001.wav|I also get to see that smile of yours.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_45002.wav|your fellow followers.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_29002.wav|Keep this teaching!
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_50001.wav|would be more than interested in engaging in this activity with you.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_44001.wav|Ugh, no, I can't... I-Is it really okay?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_46003.wav|Do not worry.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_22001.wav|I'm just kidding.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_15001.wav|Ironically, I ended up sending her a cake. Second, after the beginning of the new year, I decided to watch Miri's broadcast often.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_53003.wav|Promise?
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_28001.wav|We shall not show mercy to those devil spawns.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_1001.wav|Wow, that was such an amazing day.
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_47001.wav|perfectly healthy.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_39003.wav|You will be punished.
DUMMY1/wavs/mio_34001.wav|Is this a sin that requires 10,000 lashes?
DUMMY1/wavs/cd_12001.wav|God, you are so annoying.
